What is Network?   
Network is a collection of devices..
Networks are used for  a numbers of reasons  as given below.
 1. Information Sharing.
 2. File Sharing
 3. Resources Sharing
 4. Applications Sharing

A Network can be as small as two computers that directly connected or large as the  internet with millions of devices.

What is router?

Router is a device which makes communication between two or more different  network.

It work in layer 3 that is Network layer.

Wired Routers: 
 • It is typically box shaped devices that connect directly to computer with wired  connections.
 • It use Ethernet cables to connect your computer to a router.
 • Like one end is connect to router and other end is connected to switch and then  computer etc.
 • It support NAT (Network address translation) technologies also . Which allow Multiple   computer  to use same public IP.
 
Wireless Routers:
 • It is similar to a wired router, a wireless router connects directly to a modem via a   cable for receiving internet data packets. 
 • Wireless Router distribute data packets using one or more antennae. 
 • The router  convert that data packets, which are written in binary code like o's or 1's   in to radio signals which antenna broadcast wirelessly.
 • A machine with a wireless receiver can then receive these radio signals and 
convert  then back into binary code etc. same like Wired router   which established  wired local   area (LAN)  &  wireless  router establishes Wire Local Area.
Core Routers:
 • A Core router is a wired or wireless router that distributes internet data packets  within a network but does not distribute data packets between multiple networks.
 
Edge Routers:
 • An Edge router is a wired or wireless router that distributes Internet data packets  between one or more networks, but not distribute data packets with a network.
Virtual Router:
• Unlike a Physical wired or wireless router , a virtual router is there it is logical router for   redundancy. Like we have HSRP (Hot Standby router redundancy protocol) and  

VRRP(Virtual router redundancy Protocol ) etc.  In this we will  create logical router in  between two router like if any router go down then other router start working. We will  see this in our course. 
 
Router:
 • Routers interconnect different networks  or In simple way we can say switch is use to  connect devices with a network where as router is use 
 • to connect different networks.
 • It works on Layer 3 (Network Layer)
 • It choose the best path 

It perform Routing.
